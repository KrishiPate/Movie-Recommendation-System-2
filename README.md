# Movie-Recommendation-System-2
The project mainly involved the use of Flask, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. IMDB Dataset was used to train the model.

Three models were implemented:
1. Hybrid Recommendation using Regression, 
2. Content Based Recommendation and 
3. Collaborative Recommendation. 

The similarity code for each of them was calculated and the best results weere given as the outputs.

The TMDB API was used to access the varius attributes of a movie depending on its movie id.
